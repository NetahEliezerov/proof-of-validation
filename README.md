# Proof of Validation
Proof of validation blockchain allows nodes to validate and add new blocks by checking which block is generated by most nodes.

Every time that new block is generated,
the block is generating a validation id and adds the new block by checking which validation id is generated by most nodes

It makes the block validation much more effective.
