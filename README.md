# Proof of Validation
The Proof of Validation blockchain allows nodes to validate and add new blocks by checking which block is generated by most nodes.

Every time that new block is added,
the block is generating a validation hash and adds the new block by checking which validation hash is generated by most nodes

It makes the block validation much more effective and decentralized.
